# Dog-Breed-Classification-and-Info-Generation
This project develops a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify dog breeds from images. A user-friendly interface allows image uploads, predicts the breed, and generates relevant information. It showcases the use of AI and computer vision in real-world image classification tasks.
